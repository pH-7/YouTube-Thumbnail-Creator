## 🚀 App Store Publication

This app is designed to be published on the Mac App Store. Follow these instructions for submission:

### Prerequisites

Before starting the build process, you need:

1. An active Apple Developer account
2. App Store Connect setup for your app
3. A provisioning profile for Mac App Store distribution
4. App Store Distribution certificate

### Environment Setup

Set these environment variables before running the build script:

```bash
# Required environment variables for signing and notarization
export APPLE_ID=your_apple_id@example.com
export APPLE_ID_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
export APPLE_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
```

> **Note**: For the `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`, use an app-specific password generated from your Apple ID account page rather than your main account password.

### Provisioning Profile

Place your provisioning profile at this location:
```
/Users/pierre-henrysoria/Code/Thumbnail-Creator/build/embedded.provisionprofile
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build for development testing (Mac App Store build)
npm run mas-dev

# Build for App Store submission (doesn't auto-publish)
npm run mas-package

# Build and publish to App Store Connect
npm run mas
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Signing Issues**: Ensure your certificates are valid and installed in your keychain
2. **Entitlements Errors**: Check that the entitlements files match your provisioning profile capabilities
3. **Notarization Failures**: Verify your Apple ID and app-specific password are correct
4. **Sharp Module Issues**: If image processing fails, try rebuilding the sharp module with:
   ```bash
   npm run rebuild-sharp
   ```

### Developer Tools

- Use `electron-builder --config` to see the full configuration options
- Check the project's `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive files (like the provisioning profile) aren't committed
